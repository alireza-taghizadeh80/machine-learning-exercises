# Machine Learning Exercises

This repository contains a collection of machine learning exercises including:

- Simple Linear Regression  
- Multiple Linear Regression (Exercise 1 & Exercise 2)

Each exercise has:
- its own Jupyter Notebook  
- its own dataset  
- a small README inside the folder  

All exercises are implemented in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Jupyter Notebook.
